# perishableGoods

Android application developed for the selling of goods which can benefit the low income earners in the region, considering some goods past their best before dates, to some extent, can still be consumed, instead of thrown away. 

The idea was to have this as a charity application eventually, where some of these goods can even be donated a week before they hit the best before dates, for the needy in society, while helpig supermarkets, when they have the need to dispose some food items as required by law.
